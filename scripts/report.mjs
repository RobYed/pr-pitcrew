 * source, so a file and a line from it would be a guess wearing the clothes of
 * evidence - and a reader cannot tell those two apart. The prompt says as much;
 * this is what makes it true whatever the model does.
 *
 * `unknown` is the permissive default, for a caller that did not say. Dropping
 * fields for a kind we do not recognise would be the silent kind of strictness.
