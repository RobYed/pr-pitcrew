/**
 * The tests for the one decision fetch-issue.mjs makes: which issue, if any, a
 * pull request closes.
 *
 * Getting this wrong in the generous direction is worse than getting no issue
 * at all. The acceptance agent tests the change against the criteria in the
 * file it is handed; a neighbouring issue's criteria would send it looking for
 * behaviour nobody wrote, and the report would read exactly like a real
 * failure. Not finding an issue, by contrast, is a normal day - the prompt says
 * what to do then.
