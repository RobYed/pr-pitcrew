/**
 * Makes sure REPORT_FILE exists after the agent has finished, without paying
 * for a second review.
 *
 * Order, and the order is the point:
 *
 *   1. The file is already there. Done.
 *   2. The session already contains a usable report (the `write_report` tool,
 *      a write of the file, or JSON in the last reply that is not an echo of
 *      the prompt, the diff, or a tool output). Write it out. No model call.
 *   3. Ask the same session to call `write_report`. One turn, not a new review.
 *
 * Step 3 needs a session, and needs it proven rather than assumed. `opencode run
 * --continue` with nothing to continue does not fail - it opens a *new* session
 * whose only instruction is to call `write_report`, and a model answering that
 * from an empty context writes an empty pass. That report is indistinguishable
 * from a real one by the time it reaches the pull request, so a run whose agent
 * died before it started would publish "no defects found" for a diff nobody
 * read. The id from `session list` is the evidence, and without it this script
 * stops: a run that reviewed nothing is published as one that reviewed nothing.
 *
 * Nothing here may fail the job. A rescue that fails leaves the state
 * publish-report.mjs already knows how to describe.
 *
 * Environment: REPORT_FILE, MODEL, PITCREW_LLM_API_KEY, PITCREW_LLM_API_BASE_URL,
 * OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT (the last four only for the continue turn).
 * SESSION_EXPORT skips the CLI listing and reads that file instead — the
 * try-it-out path, same as publish-transcript.mjs.
