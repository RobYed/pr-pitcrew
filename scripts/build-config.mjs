/**
 * Turns an agent directory into the configuration OpenCode is run with, and
 * fills in the prompt's placeholders.
 *
 * Everything here comes from *this package* at the ref the consumer pinned:
 * the agent manifest, its permission profile, the prompt. Nothing comes from
 * the repository under review. That is the whole point of the file. In the
 * bundle this grew out of, the configuration was a file in the reviewed
 * repository, and a pull request that edited it could grant its own reviewer a
 * shell. It could not quite, because the action read the file early and passed
 * it inline - but the defence was a matter of timing, and timing is a thing
 * that gets refactored away. Now the reviewed repository has no vote.
 *
 * Two invariants are worth stating out loud, because both were once bugs:
 *
 *  * **`default_agent` is what selects the agent.** The OpenCode GitHub action
 *    ignores its own `agent` input (`github.handler.ts` omits the agent when it
 *    prompts the session and falls back to `build`, which allows everything).
 *    For months every run of the original bundle was that `build` agent, while
 *    a carefully written permission block sat in the repository doing nothing.
 *    A permission that never applies looks exactly like one that does.
 *  * **Nothing falls back quietly.** An unknown agent, an unknown profile, a
 *    missing prompt, no model, no endpoint: each ends the run with a message
 *    naming the fix. A default here would be somebody's bill.
 *
 * CLI: `node build-config.mjs`, with PITCREW_HOME, AGENT, MODEL, BASE_URL and
 * the placeholder values in the environment; writes CONFIG_OUT, MODEL_OUT and
 * PROMPT_OUT.

/**
 * The prompt refers to its inputs by name and this is where those names get
 * values - before the agent ever sees the text.
 *
 * It has to happen here. **An agent without a shell cannot resolve an
 * environment variable**, and the two review agents are exactly that. Until
 * this existed, `$DIFF_FILE` reached them as those eleven characters and every
 * review rested on the model guessing the path. In the run log it looked like
 * this: the agent read the project's AGENTS.md, ran `glob **\/DIFF_FILE*`,
 * found nothing and replied that it could not start - with the diff sitting
 * next to it the whole time.
 *
 * An allowlist, not the whole environment. This process holds the model key
 * and, in the acceptance job, the credentials of the environment under test; a
 * prompt is echoed into the run log, and a credential has no business in one.
 * The agent that needs those has a shell and reads them from its own
 * environment, which is why the acceptance prompt names them without a `$`.
