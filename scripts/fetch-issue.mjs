/**
 * Puts the issue a pull request closes into a file, so the agent does not have
 * to go and get it.
 *
 * The acceptance agent used to be told to run `gh issue view <number>`. Two
 * things were wrong with that. `gh` is not in every runner image - it is not in
 * the Playwright one this agent runs in - so on a bad day the instruction was a
 * no-op and the agent invented criteria from the pull request title. And an
 * agent that has to fetch things needs the rights to fetch things; one that is
 * handed a file needs none.
 *
 * Not finding an issue is not a failure. Plenty of pull requests close nothing,
 * and the prompt says what to do then: derive what the change claims from its
 * title, body and diff, and say in the report that you did.
 *
 * Environment: GITHUB_REPOSITORY, PR_NUMBER, ISSUE_FILE, GITHUB_TOKEN.
