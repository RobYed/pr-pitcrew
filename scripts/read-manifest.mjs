/**
 * Reads one agent manifest and writes what the workflow needs to know about it

 *
 * The manifest is the single place an agent is described. Before it existed, an
 * agent was spread over five: a prompt file, a permission block, a workflow, a
 * title in an environment variable and a slash command in a job's `if:`. The
 * two review agents' permission blocks were identical character for character,
 * which is the state a fourth agent copies and a fifth quietly diverges from.
 *
 * Environment: PITCREW_HOME, AGENT. Writes: title, report, wants-diff,
 * wants-issue, wants-target, command, check.
