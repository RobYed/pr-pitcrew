/**
 * Which pull-request comments belong to *this* review, when several reviews
 * share a workflow run.
 *
 * Under the orchestrator, bug review, security review and the acceptance test
 * are jobs of one run. OpenCode puts that run's link on every reply, and
 * publish-report.mjs used to treat the link as identity: rewrite the newest,
 * delete the rest. The slower job then erased the faster one's report. The
 * run id is still what keeps a person who quotes the link out of the set; it
 * is no longer enough to tell the three jobs apart.
 *
 * Ownership is the marker the frame writes, which carries the review name.
 * A raw OpenCode reply has no marker yet; it may be claimed only if it is not
 * still `[Working...]` — OpenCode updates that placeholder at the end of its
 * step, and rewriting it is how one review's frame vanished under another's.
 */

/**
 * The marker is functional, not decoration: it is how a run recognises the
 * comments of its own earlier runs. Renaming it is therefore a migration, and
 * the old names stay readable — a repository that upgrades mid-pull-request
 * would otherwise post every standing finding a second time and count none of
 * them towards the quality gate. Written: the first. Recognised: all three.
