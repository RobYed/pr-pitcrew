/**
 * Puts the diff the agent should review into a file, and says which diff it is.
 *
 * On the first review of a pull request there is only one sensible answer: the
 * whole thing. On a later push there are two, and the difference decides whether
 * this bundle is worth keeping. Handing over the whole diff again invites the
 * agent to re-litigate code that was already reviewed - and every round it may
 * word an old objection slightly differently, so it reads as a new finding.
 * A pull request then never converges: fix, review, fix, review.
 *
 * So a push is reviewed as the commits since the last *published* review of
 * this agent on this pull request, while the checkout still holds the whole
 * pull request for context. `github.event.before` is the last push, not the
 * last complete review. A new push cancels the run that is not complete, and
 * that cancelled check sits on the old commit. If the new run used `before`
 * as the start of the range, the cancelled commits would never be reviewed.
 * The walk below starts at `before` and moves to the newest parent that
 * published a report. `publish-report.mjs` drops anything that lands on a
 * line somebody has already commented on, as the second line of defence.
 *
 * Falls back to the full diff whenever the incremental one cannot be trusted:
 * a force-push leaves `before` unreachable, a comment trigger has no `before`
 * at all, the walk finds no published review, and a failed lookup must not
 * guess. `/review` is how a human asks for the whole pull request to be
 * looked at again.
 *
 * The same parse that writes the diff also writes the list of paths the agent
 * has to open. The hunk is three lines of context; the file is what the change
 * means. Without that list, nothing downstream can tell a review that opened
 * the files from one that only read the hunks.
