/**
 * Turns an agent's report into the three things a reviewer actually reads: one
 * summary comment on the pull request, inline comments at the code, and the same
 * report again in the run summary.
 *
 * The split matters. What the inline comments add is anchoring: a finding
 * sitting next to the line it is about gets fixed, the same finding in a long
 * comment gets skimmed. What the summary comment adds is a fixed shape - and,
 * for a run that produced criteria rather than findings, the criteria table and
 * a link to the artifact holding the recording, so that the outcome is readable
 * without leaving the pull request.
 *
 * A finding whose line is not part of the diff cannot be anchored - GitHub
 * answers 422 - so it is moved into the review body rather than dropped. A
 * finding that disappears because of an API rule is worse than an ugly one.
 *
 * Report format (all fields optional, unknown fields ignored):
 *
 *   { "verdict": "pass" | "attention" | "fail",
 *     "summary": "markdown",
 *     "findings": [{ "file", "line", "severity", "title", "body" }],
 *     "criteria": [{ "title", "status", "at", "evidence" }] }
 *
 * Publishing comes first and the exit code last, always: a gate that failed a
 * run before its findings were on the pull request would hide exactly the
 * information the red check is about.
 *
 * Exit codes, because a red check has to say which kind of red it is:
 *
 *   0  the quality gate holds
 *   1  findings at or above the threshold - this run's, or earlier ones nobody
 *      has fixed or dismissed
 *   2  no usable report: the agent wrote none, or wrote something that is not
 *      JSON. Nothing was reviewed, which is not the same as nothing was found.
 *   3  the report exists but could not be published
 *
 * Environment: GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_REPOSITORY, PR_NUMBER, REVIEW_TITLE,
 * optionally REPORT_FILE, RUN_URL, ARTIFACT_NAME, ARTIFACT_LABEL, DRY_RUN,
 * PITCREW_FAIL_ON, PITCREW_FAIL_ON_NO_REPORT, PITCREW_REQUIRE_FULL_COVERAGE,
 * COVERAGE_FILE.
